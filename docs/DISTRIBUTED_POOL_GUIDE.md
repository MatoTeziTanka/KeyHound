# KeyHound Enhanced - Distributed Pool Guide

## üåç Community-Powered Bitcoin Puzzle Solving

The KeyHound Enhanced Distributed Pool is a revolutionary community-driven system that allows anyone to contribute their computing power to solve Bitcoin puzzles and earn fair rewards based on their hardware performance.

## üéØ How It Works

### Pool Structure
- **Pool Owner (You)**: Receives 40% of any found Bitcoin
- **Key Finder**: Receives 20% bonus for finding the private key
- **Community**: Receives 40% distributed fairly based on hardware performance

### Fair Reward Distribution
- **Hardware Performance Scoring**: 1-minute and 1-hour tests determine your contribution level
- **Multi-Device Support**: Run on multiple devices (phones, PCs, servers) for higher rewards
- **Performance Tracking**: Weekly cycles with hourly adjustments for optimal fairness
- **Secure Key Delivery**: Only the pool owner receives found private keys

## üöÄ Quick Start

## üîß Hardware Performance Scoring

### Performance Test Phases

#### Phase 1: Quick Assessment (1 minute)
- **Private Key Generation**: Tests CPU performance
- **Address Generation**: Tests Bitcoin cryptography
- **Puzzle Solving**: Tests overall solving capability

#### Phase 2: Comprehensive Analysis (1 hour)
- **Extended Performance Tests**: More accurate scoring
- **Memory Stress Testing**: Evaluates sustained performance
- **Power Efficiency**: Rewards efficient devices

### Scoring Factors

1. **Base Hardware Score**:
   - CPU cores √ó frequency
   - RAM capacity
   - GPU count and memory
   - Device type (server/PC/mobile)

2. **Performance Score**:
   - Operations per second across all tests
   - Consistency across test runs
   - Sustained performance over time

3. **Efficiency Score**:
   - Performance per watt consumed
   - Mobile devices get efficiency bonus
   - Battery-powered devices get efficiency consideration

4. **Power Score**:
   - Sustained performance over time
   - Consistency across different workloads
   - Reliability factor

### Reward Percentage Calculation

- **Minimum**: 0.1% of found Bitcoin
- **Maximum**: 5.0% of found Bitcoin
- **Multi-Device Bonus**: Up to 2x for multiple devices
- **Performance Scaling**: Linear scaling based on combined score

## üìä Performance Tracking Cycles

### Weekly Performance Cycles

1. **1 Hour**: Initial performance assessment
2. **6 Hours**: Early performance validation
