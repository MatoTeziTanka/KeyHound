### Problem
The original structure had redundant nested `keyhound/keyhound/` directories, making imports complex and the structure confusing.

### Solution
Flattened the package structure to eliminate redundant naming:
- Moved all modules from `keyhound/keyhound/` to root level
- Simplified imports from `from keyhound.module import` to `from module import`
- Maintained clean organization with proper `__init__.py` files

### Impact
- ‚úÖ Simplified imports and module structure
- ‚úÖ Industry-standard Python project layout
- ‚úÖ Easier navigation and maintenance
- ‚úÖ Cleaner entry point (`main.py`)

Systematically removed all duplicates:

- Consolidated test files (kept `simple_functionality_test.py`)
- Removed duplicate validation scripts
- Eliminated redundant structure files

### Impact
- ‚úÖ Clean, maintainable codebase
