### Problem
The original structure had redundant nested `keyhound/keyhound/` directories, making imports complex and the structure confusing.

### Solution
Flattened the package structure to eliminate redundant naming:
- Moved all modules from `keyhound/keyhound/` to root level
- Simplified imports from `from keyhound.module import` to `from module import`
- Maintained clean organization with proper `__init__.py` files

### Impact
- ✅ Simplified imports and module structure
- ✅ Industry-standard Python project layout
- ✅ Easier navigation and maintenance
- ✅ Cleaner entry point (`main.py`)

Multiple duplicate files existed causing confusion and maintenance issues:

### Solution
Systematically removed all duplicates:
- Kept only working `requirements.txt` (removed non-existent packages)
- Consolidated test files (kept `simple_functionality_test.py`)
- Removed duplicate validation scripts
- Eliminated redundant structure files

### Impact
- ✅ Clean, maintainable codebase
- ✅ No confusion about which files to use
- ✅ Reduced repository size
- ✅ Single source of truth for each file type
