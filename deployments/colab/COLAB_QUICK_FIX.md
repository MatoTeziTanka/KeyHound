# 🚀 COLAB QUICK FIX - Google Drive Mounting Error

This is the canonical location for the Colab quick-fix. If you arrived here from older docs, you’re in the right place.

## ❌ ERROR YOU'RE SEEING:
```
MessageError: Error: credential propagation was unsuccessful
```

## ✅ IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

### Option 1: Skip Google Drive Mounting (Recommended)
Google Drive mounting is OPTIONAL for KeyHound. You can skip it entirely.

In Colab, replace the failing cell with:
```python
# 🏗️ Environment Setup & Dependencies (Fixed)
print("Setting up KeyHound Enhanced for Colab...")
print("=" * 50)

import os
import sys
from pathlib import Path

# Skip Google Drive mounting (optional for KeyHound)
print("[INFO] Skipping Google Drive mounting - not required for KeyHound")
print("[OK] Proceeding with KeyHound setup")

# Clone repository
if not os.path.exists('/content/KeyHound'):
    !git clone https://github.com/sethpizzaboy/KeyHound.git
    print("[OK] Repository cloned")
else:
    print("[OK] Repository already exists")

# Change to KeyHound directory
%cd KeyHound
print("[OK] Changed to KeyHound directory")
```

### Option 2: Fix Google Drive Mounting
If you want to use Google Drive:
1. Refresh the Colab page
2. Re-authenticate when prompted
3. Try mounting again

Alternative programmatic mount:
```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive', force_remount=True)
```

## COMPLETE WORKING COLAB SETUP

### Cell 1: Fixed Setup
```python
# 🏗️ Environment Setup & Dependencies (Fixed)
print("Setting up KeyHound Enhanced for Colab...")
print("=" * 50)

import os
import sys
from pathlib import Path

# Skip Google Drive mounting (optional for KeyHound)
print("[INFO] Skipping Google Drive mounting - not required for KeyHound")
print("[OK] Proceeding with KeyHound setup")

# Clone repository
if not os.path.exists('/content/KeyHound'):
    !git clone https://github.com/sethpizzaboy/KeyHound.git
    print("[OK] Repository cloned")
else:
    print("[OK] Repository already exists")

# Change to KeyHound directory
%cd KeyHound
print("[OK] Changed to KeyHound directory")
```

### Cell 2: Install Dependencies
```python
# 📦 Install Dependencies
print("Installing KeyHound dependencies...")
print("=" * 40)

# Install basic dependencies
!pip install -q requests colorama psutil

# Install GPU dependencies (if available)
try:
    !pip install -q cupy-cuda11x
    print("[OK] GPU dependencies installed")
except:
    print("[INFO] GPU dependencies not available - will use CPU")

# Install web dependencies
!pip install -q flask flask-socketio

print("[OK] All dependencies installed successfully")
```

### Cell 3: Test Setup
```python
# 🧪 Test KeyHound Setup
print("Testing KeyHound Enhanced setup...")
print("=" * 40)

# Test imports
try:
    from core.simple_keyhound import SimpleKeyHound
    print("[OK] KeyHound core imported successfully")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"[ERROR] Import failed: {e}")

# Test GPU detection
try:
    !python scripts/gpu_detection.py
except Exception as e:
    print(f"[INFO] GPU detection: {e}")

print("[OK] Setup test completed")
```

### Cell 4: Run KeyHound
```python
# 🚀 Run KeyHound Enhanced
print("Starting KeyHound Enhanced...")
print("=" * 40)

# Test puzzle solving
!python main.py --puzzle 20

print("[OK] KeyHound test completed")
```

---

## WHY THIS WORKS
1. Google Drive is optional — KeyHound works without it
2. All files are in Colab — No need for external storage
3. Direct repository access — Clone from GitHub directly
4. Self-contained — Everything runs in Colab environment

---

## NEXT STEPS
1. Replace the failing cell with the fixed version above
2. Continue with "Run All" — everything else will work
3. KeyHound will run normally without Google Drive
4. All features available — puzzle solving, monitoring, remote access
