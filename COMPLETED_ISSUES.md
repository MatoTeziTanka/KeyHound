### Issue #1: Eliminate Redundant File Structure
- **Title**: `[REFACTOR] Eliminate redundant file structure - flatten keyhound package`
- **Labels**: `type: refactor`, `priority: high`, `component: core`, `status: completed`
- **Milestone**: `v1.0.0 - Foundation Complete`
- **Description**:
```
## üèóÔ∏è Structural Improvement

### Problem
The original structure had redundant nested `keyhound/keyhound/` directories, making imports complex and the structure confusing.

### Solution
Flattened the package structure to eliminate redundant naming:
- Moved all modules from `keyhound/keyhound/` to root level
- Simplified imports from `from keyhound.module import` to `from module import`
- Maintained clean organization with proper `__init__.py` files

### Impact
- ‚úÖ Simplified imports and module structure
- ‚úÖ Industry-standard Python project layout
- ‚úÖ Easier navigation and maintenance
- ‚úÖ Cleaner entry point (`main.py`)

### Commits
- `a3dc7e4` - MAJOR RESTRUCTURE: Flatten keyhound package to root level

### Files Changed
- All module files moved to root level
- Updated all import statements
- Maintained functionality while improving structure
```

### Issue #2: Remove Duplicate Files
- **Title**: `[REFACTOR] Remove duplicate files and clean codebase`
- **Labels**: `type: refactor`, `priority: high`, `component: core`, `status: completed`

## üßπ Codebase Cleanup

### Problem
Multiple duplicate files existed causing confusion and maintenance issues:
- Duplicate requirements.txt files
- Duplicate test files
- Duplicate validation files
- Duplicate structure files

### Solution
Systematically removed all duplicates:
- Kept only working `requirements.txt` (removed non-existent packages)
- Consolidated test files (kept `simple_functionality_test.py`)
- Removed duplicate validation scripts
- Eliminated redundant structure files

### Impact
- ‚úÖ Clean, maintainable codebase
- ‚úÖ No confusion about which files to use
- ‚úÖ Reduced repository size
- ‚úÖ Single source of truth for each file type

### Commits
- `f4ae95e` - Remove duplicate requirements files
- `da490b6` - Remove duplicate test files
- `af2dcc3` - Remove duplicate validation files
- `0aa7e81` - Remove duplicate optimal structure files
```

### Issue #3: Optimize File Organization
- **Title**: `[REFACTOR] Optimize file organization and eliminate duplicates`
- **Labels**: `type: refactor`, `priority: medium`, `component: deployment`, `status: completed`
- **Milestone**: `v1.0.0 - Foundation Complete`
- **Description**:

## üìÅ File Organization Optimization

### Problem
Files were scattered and some duplicates remained:
- Config files in multiple locations
- Deployment files duplicated
- Test files in wrong locations
- Root directory cluttered

### Solution
Organized everything properly:
- Moved `docker.yaml` to `config/environments/`
- Removed duplicate `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` from root
- Moved test files to `tests/` directory
- Moved scripts to `scripts/` directory
- Clean root directory with only essential files

### Impact
- ‚úÖ Professional project structure
- ‚úÖ Clear file organization
- ‚úÖ No duplicate files
- ‚úÖ Easy navigation and maintenance

### Commits
- `d892488` - Perfect file structure organization

### Final Structure

```
## üîß Import Path Resolution

### Problem
After structural changes, import paths were broken:
- Modules couldn't find each other
- Relative imports were incorrect
- Absolute imports were outdated
- Import errors in multiple files

### Solution
Fixed all import paths systematically:
- Updated all `from src.module import` to relative imports
- Fixed `from keyhound.module import` to `from .module import`
- Corrected cross-module imports
- Ensured all modules can import each other

### Impact
- ‚úÖ All imports working correctly
- ‚úÖ No module import errors
- ‚úÖ Clean relative import structure
- ‚úÖ Maintainable import system

### Commits
- `a6cfea1` - All file paths corrected after reorganization

### Files Fixed
- All core modules
- GPU modules
- ML modules
- Web modules
- Distributed modules
```

### Issue #5: Restore Missing Core Package

- **Milestone**: `v1.0.0 - Foundation Complete`
- **Description**:
```
## üö® Critical Recovery

### Problem
During cleanup, the core `keyhound_enhanced.py` file was accidentally deleted, breaking the main functionality.

### Solution
Recreated the core file with all original functionality:
- Restored `core/keyhound_enhanced.py` with complete implementation
- Updated imports to match new structure
- Maintained all original features and functionality
- Ensured compatibility with new organization

### Impact
- ‚úÖ Core functionality restored
- ‚úÖ Application working again
- ‚úÖ All features available
